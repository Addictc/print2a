M4A1 - CAD Assembly and Schematics 

It was modeled exactly to Colt/Government specifications.

- The schematics are provided in the .tiff format.

  You can use Adobe Acrobat Reader or open the images with Paint on your Windows computer.
  There are dedicated viewers available that are found on the internet that will work better. 
  You should limit the number of pages you open at once, as their file sizes are bigger than with conventional image files.


- The drawings included here are all schematics for the various components and assemblies of the M4A1.

  There are two folders - "Assemblies" and "Components".
  The "Assemblies" folder contains the schematics showing various assemblies and sub-assemblies of the M4A1 carbine.
  The "Components" folder contains the page-by-page view of each component with dimensions for that component. 
  Some components have multiple pages - you can identify these components by looking at their filename (for example, pin-firing0001.tif).
  If a page called pin-firing0002.tif exists, it is the second page for the part 'pin-firing', with pin-firing0001.tif being the first page for that part.
